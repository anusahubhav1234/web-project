                    <p> 
                        
                        My name is Anubhav Sahu, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree at MLR Institute of Technology and Management (MLRITM) in Hyderabad. I hail from Rajgangpur, Odisha, where I completed my intermediate education at Saierc. This formative period was crucial in shaping my academic interests and career aspirations.
                        
                        Since relocating to Hyderabad, I have immersed myself in the diverse and dynamic environment of MLRITM. My studies focus on Computer Science, where I am keen on exploring innovative technologies and solving complex problems. Through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, I am developing a robust technical foundation.
                        
                        In addition to my academic pursuits, I actively engage in  extracurricular activities e.g sports , dance and tech club. These experiences allow me to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios and collaborate with peers who share similar interests. I am particularly interested in  software development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, which I believe will drive my future career path.
                        
                        Outside of my studies, I enjoy  reading, coding, playing sports. These activities provide a well-rounded balance to my academic life and help me stay motivated and focused. My time in Hyderabad has been both challenging and enriching, and I am enthusiastic about the opportunities that lie ahead.
                        
                        Looking forward, I am committed to leveraging my education and experiences to contribute effectively to the technology sector and to make a positive impact through my work.
